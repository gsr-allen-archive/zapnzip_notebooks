    "1. Coherence is susciptible to volume conduction. A good way to get around this is to use only the imaginary part of coherence (volume conduction signals should have a nearly zero delay (speed of light), and thus, in the cross-spectrum, will have zero phase lag, and contribute only to the real part of coherence).\n",
    "1. Coherence depends on taking the fourier transform. The longer the signal, the more stable the estimation of fourier transform. However, it also assumes stationarity of the signal, i.e. the fourier components do not change much in time within the window. A shorter signal guarantees stationarity better. Thus there is a trade off and it needs to be deicded what is the best window.  \n",
    "   For now, I will use a 5s long window. This is 5x the minimum frequency of 1 Hz that we care about, so long enough but not super long. For higher frequency bands, this window might be too long?"
